Order of operations:
        Create components for each element type (h1,button) - used one for simplicity (turned buttons comp into watch comp)
        Create a h1 element to pass information to
        create 3 buttons (start,pause,restart)
        utilizing a class component include a function that increments numbers by one on click
        use setInterval to automate the update of incrementation by 1s (1000)
        include setState to manipulate the default state of count
        pass a reference to that function to the start button
        utilizing a class component include a function that holds incrementation on click
        use clearInterval to stop setInterval from updating
        pass a variable assigned to setInterval as an argument in clearInterval function
        pass a reference to that function to the pause button
        utilizing a class component include a function that restarts the watch
        use setState to call the default state 
        use another instance of clearInterval to stop the count as well
        pass a reference to that function to the restart button
